# COVID-19 Map website repository

This is a simple interactive map to show:

- Confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita
- Confirmed deaths of COVID-19 per capita
- Confirmed recovered of COVID-19 per capita

The data used comes from:

- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
- Countries border, names and population data from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/

## Main tools used:

- [leaflet](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Color Brewer 2](https://colorbrewer2.org)
